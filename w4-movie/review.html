            <h2>REVIEW</h2>

            <p><b>Victorino Gomes</b><i> August 10, 2024</i></p>
            <br>
            <p><em>Creed</em> is a complex drama. Even though <em>Creed</em> is a boxing movie, it is more about the story of a boy becoming a man, but also learning how to build his own path and legacy as a man. The movie follows <i>Adonis Creed</i>, son of <em>Apollo Creed</em> build his own boxing legacy by separating himself from his fathers legacy. The story building and pacing is not only amazing but consistent through the entire movie. </p>
            <br>
            <p>My favorite part of the movie is when <i>Adonis</i> loses in the beginning of the movie. It helps establish how confident and cocky <i>Adonis</i> truly is despite his extreme skill. I liked the fact <i>Adonis</i> wasn't portrayed as an invinsible force.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Trivia</h3>
            <ul>

                <li>Michael B. Jordan actually took a real punch for a lot of the cinematic knockdown scenes.</li>
                <li><em>Creed</em> is the 7th film in the <em>Rocky</em> franchise.</li>
            </ul>
